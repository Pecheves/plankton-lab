Pedro Echeveste is a professor of oceanography and plankton biology at the Universidad de Antofagasta, Chile. His research interests include biological oceanography, ecotoxicology, plankton ecology, harmful algal blooms and Global Change.

From 2006 to 2011, he did his PhD at the Instituto Mediterráneo de Estudios Avanzados (Spain), analyzing the effects of persistent organic pollutants (POP) and trace metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, Zn) to cultured and natural communities of phytoplankton of the Mediterranean and Black Seas and the Atlantic, Arctic and Southern Oceans. Later in 2012, he worked as a postdoc at the Universidade Federal de São Carlos (Brazil), analyzing the biochemical and physiological effects of metals on freshwater phytoplankton. After that, in 2015 he joined the Pontificia Universidad Católica (Chile) to investigate the role of trace metals (Fe and Cu) on the composition and distribution of phytoplankton of the Humboldt Current System (HCS). Currently, he is interested in the role of microbial communities in the anthropogenically-impacted biogeochemical cycles of aquatic ecosystems and how these communities adapt to environmental perturbations. Besides, he is interested on the impact of both legacy and new emerging chemicals to microorganisms and the role of these communities on the fate of nutrients and contaminants. Also, he is interested in how global change will alter not only the fitness of microorganisms, but also the reactivity of the different compounds occurring in water and the role of microorganisms in altering water conditions, such as eutrophication processes, harmful algal blooms occurrence or the formation of oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) and its coupling to low pH conditions (high pCO2).
